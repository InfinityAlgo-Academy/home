## 1. Quick Definition

The ACD Indicator for MetaTrader 5 is a session-based trading tool derived from the Opening Range Breakout methodology, designed to identify intraday directional bias and key price levels.

---

## 2. What Problem Does It Solve?

Many intraday traders struggle with defining clear directional bias early in the trading session and identifying valid breakout levels. Random entries during low-structure periods often lead to inconsistent results. The ACD Indicator exists to provide a systematic framework that defines opening ranges, directional conditions, and decision zones based on time and price behavior.

---

## 3. How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. The indicator defines a specific opening session based on user-defined time settings.
2. It calculates the Opening Range using the session’s high and low.
3. Predefined offsets (A levels) are projected above and below the opening range.
4. Price acceptance above or below these levels determines bullish or bearish bias.
5. Additional conditions help filter false breakouts and indecisive market behavior.

## 8. Comparison

Compared to standard Opening Range Breakout indicators, the ACD Indicator adds a structured bias framework rather than simple breakout signals. Unlike basic ORB tools, ACD emphasizes price acceptance beyond defined levels, reducing false signals caused by short-lived volatility spikes.

---

## 9. Who Should Use This Tool?

The ACD Indicator is ideal for intraday traders who prefer rule-based decision-making and structured session analysis. It is also suitable for intermediate traders looking to move away from indicator clutter toward time-and-price-based logic.

---

## 10. FAQ

**Q1: Is the ACD Indicator automated?**
No. It provides analytical levels and bias, not automated trade execution.

**Q2: Can it be used on any market?**
It works best on liquid markets with clear session opens, such as Forex and indices.

**Q3: Does it repaint?**
No. Once the opening range and A-levels are established, they remain fixed for the session.
